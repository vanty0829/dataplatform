LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is a protocol used to access and manage directory information over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. LDAP is commonly used for:

</br>

- Directory Services: Storing information about users, groups, devices, and other resources in a hierarchical manner.
- Authentication: Verifying user credentials for access control in various applications and services.
- Centralized Management: Providing a central repository for managing user and resource information, making it easier to administer and secure.

LDAP is often implemented in organizational settings for managing user directories and integrating with other systems.
